Description: A fork of the gtx package, which has been streamlined to 
	operate in an environment where genetic data and summary 
	statistics are available via SQL queries against a database.

=======
Description: Assorted tools for genetic and pharmacogenetic association 
	analyses.  There are functions for simplifying and standardising 
	pharmacogenetic analysis and reporting.  There are functions to 
	support multi-SNP risk score analyses, multi-SNP conditional 
	regression analyses, and multi-phenotype analyses, using summary 
	statistics instead of using subject-specific data.  There are 
	helper functions for reading and manipulating subject-specific 
	genotype data, which provide a platform for calculating the 
	summary statistics, or for using R to conduct other analyses not 
	supported by specific GWAS analysis tools.
